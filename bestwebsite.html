    <h3 style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:antiquewhite"><strong>Guess fucking what?!?!</strong></h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:antiquewhite">
        This shit is <strong>EASY to read.</strong> There's not 5 paragraphs it fits on one page.
        <br />
        It's so short and perfedct even your 3 y/o fucking cousin can read this.
        <br />
        Also, have you considered placing your shit not far left so you can fucking read.
        <br />
        All this shit fits on one 17 inch monitor basic zoom. You don't need to scroll 8 years to read shit.
        <br />
        White on Black. That simple. Zero eye piercing black on white.
        <br />
        In total including tags this is <strong>BARELY</strong> over 60 lines of "code." (html and css are bullshit but ok-)
        <br />
        This is the perfect fucking site. Prove me wrong; I fucking dare you.

        <br />
        Tell me a better, and simpler webiste- <strong>ILL FUCKING WAIT!</strong>

    <h3 style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:antiquewhite"><strong>BLANK SPACE,</strong></h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:antiquewhite">
        Holy SHIT! None of you fuckers use blank space in your code or on your website, but those who do put way too fucking much.
        <br />
